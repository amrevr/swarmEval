"""Layer 3 -- diagnostic engine: smell prevalence over a set of runs (Phase 2).

One run is one observation.  A smell found several times in a run (two
dead agents, two bloated agents) counts once for that run; the agents it
involved are counted once per run too.  Smells are grouped by name only, so
the report reads "dead_agent in 8/8 runs (researcher_c 8)" rather than one
line per agent.  The representative observation / hypothesis / intervention
is taken from the most severe occurrence (ties: the earliest run).

Classes:
- SmellPrevalence: How often one smell was seen. ``prevalence`` = runs_affected ÷ n_runs; ``severity_counts`` counts
  runs by their most severe occurrence; ``agents`` counts, per agent, the runs in which the smell involved it;
  ``inferred_runs`` the runs where every occurrence rested on inferred evidence; ``example_runs`` up to three run
  ids, most severe first.
- DiagnosticsReport: Smell prevalence over runs, sorted by most severe occurrence, then prevalence, then name.
  ``total`` counts diagnostics before the per-run deduplication.
