# SwarmEval — Design Document

> An evaluation, observability, diagnostic, and causal analysis framework for multi-agent AI systems.

This document is the project's charter: what SwarmEval measures, why, and in what order it is being built. The README covers usage; this covers the reasoning. Module references below name where each piece lives or will live; see §11 for what is implemented so far.

## 1. Core idea

Given a task and a multi-agent system, SwarmEval records the execution as a structured trajectory and analyses it at multiple levels:

```
Task → Outcome → Trajectory → Agent behaviour → Communication → Dependencies → Coordination → Architecture
```

producing quantitative evaluation (what happened), qualitative diagnosis (why), and counterfactual analysis (what would happen if the system changed).

## 2. Foundational principle

Trajectory observability and causal ablation are the foundation; everything else builds on them.

```
Trajectory Observability + Causal Ablation
              ↓
      Reliable Understanding
              ↓
      Coordination Analysis → Diagnostics → Resilience Analysis → Architecture Evaluation → Optimization
```

**Observability** answers *what happened*: agent invocations, LLM calls, tool calls, inputs, outputs, messages, dependencies, timing, tokens, costs, errors, artifacts, downstream usage, evaluation signals.

> If the execution cannot be represented as structured events, it cannot be reliably analysed.

**Causal ablation** answers *what changed because a component was present*: remove an agent, tool, channel, model, context, ordering or budget; re-run; compare. This separates *observed activity* from *causal contribution*. An agent can generate thousands of tokens and contribute nothing; another can do very little and prevent a major downstream failure.

Implementation: `swarmeval.schema` (events) and `swarmeval.recorder` (capture) exist today; `swarmeval.causal` (ablation) is Phase 3.

## 3. Measurement layers

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      TASK PERFORMANCE       │  success, correctness, constraints, quality
├─────────────────────────────┤
│         EFFICIENCY          │  cost, latency, critical path
├─────────────────────────────┤
│    COORDINATION QUALITY     │  utilization, communication, redundancy, dependencies, parallelism
├─────────────────────────────┤
│   ROBUSTNESS & CAUSALITY    │  ablation, failure injection, resilience
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

Separate layers prevent a system from scoring "good" just because it solved the task while being expensive or badly coordinated.

### Layer 1 — Task performance (`metrics/performance.py`, `evaluators.py`)
Success rate, correctness score, constraint satisfaction, tool-use correctness, groundedness, task-specific criteria. Deterministic evaluators and LLM judges; LLM judging supports multiple judgments, agreement and confidence rather than treating one model's verdict as truth.

### Layer 2 — Efficiency (`metrics/efficiency.py`)
Cost: input/output/total tokens, LLM and tool call counts, estimated API cost, cost per successful task. Latency: wall clock, critical path, agent compute time, waiting time, total work. Wall-clock time is not total work: a swarm may do 60s of aggregate work in 15s through parallelism.

### Layer 3 — Coordination quality (`metrics/coordination.py`, `graph/`)
The core analytical layer: did multiple agents actually produce useful coordination, or only complexity?

* **Agent utilization** — actions, tokens, tools, artifacts, messages, downstream references. Utilization is *not* contribution.
* **Agent contribution** — *observed* (provenance: artifacts consumed downstream, messages used, lineage of the final output) vs *marginal* (ablation). SwarmEval never says "Agent X contributed 12%"; it says "removing Agent X reduced task success by 12 points under this configuration".
* **Redundant work** — duplicate tool calls, similar artifacts, shared sources; *accidental* redundancy distinguished from *intentional verification* (critic/verifier roles, `intent="verification"`).
* **Communication overhead** — message counts and tokens, category split (useful work / information transfer / coordination), repeated and broadcast messages, hub share. Communication is not automatically waste.
* **Dependency efficiency** — necessary vs unused edges, depth, fan-in/out, cycles, serial bottlenecks, isolated agents.
* **Parallelism** — theoretical (dependency-allowed) vs actual overlap; the gap is an optimization opportunity, subject to rate limits and deliberate synchronisation.
* **Context bloat** — tokens received vs tokens relevant (task + referenced artifacts).

### Layer 4 — Robustness & causality (`causal/`)
Agent, tool and architecture ablation; failure injection (crash, delay, dropped/corrupted messages, malformed tool output, tool errors, LLM errors, budgets); resilience = success under failure ÷ normal success; quality retention, recovery cost and latency.

## 4. Trajectory graph (`graph/builder.py`)

Every execution is a graph. Nodes carry timing, model, tokens, tools, inputs, outputs, errors and cost; edges carry sender, receiver, timestamp, tokens, dependency type, and whether downstream behaviour used them. Two views:

* **Agent graph** — message, artifact and invocation edges; supports fan-in/out, cycles, density, isolated agents, bottlenecks.
* **Work-unit DAG** — LLM and tool calls with inferred dependencies (sequential order within a span, messages, artifact provenance, nesting); supports critical path, depth, theoretical parallelism.

Dependencies are inferred from what was recorded. Unrecorded channels make the DAG under-count dependencies and over-estimate parallelism.

## 5. Swarm smells (`diagnostics/smells.py`)

ESLint for agent architectures. Each smell is a *hypothesis from trajectory evidence*, reported as observation → hypothesis → intervention to test:

| Smell | Signal |
|---|---|
| Redundant delegation | several agents send one agent similar requests |
| Agent ping-pong | repeated alternating exchanges between two agents |
| Over-agentization | many agents for a simple task; many low-contribution agents |
| Under-specialization | "specialised" agents doing overlapping work |
| Coordinator bottleneck | most messages pass through one agent; high token share; on the critical path; no bypass |
| Premature synthesis / late information | an agent reasons before its inputs exist, or receives them after its last call |
| Context bloat | input tokens far exceed relevant tokens |
| Dead / zero-value agent | output never used downstream and absent from the final output's lineage |
| Serialized execution | large gap between potential and actual parallelism |
| Communication overhead | message tokens are a large share of LLM tokens |

Cross-run aggregation (`diagnostics/engine.py`) reports prevalence.

## 6. Counterfactual evaluation (`causal/`)

Instead of "did the swarm succeed?" ask "what happens when we intervene?". Interventions: remove agent/tool, disable channel, change model, restrict context/budget, change ordering or parallelism (swarm params), introduce failures. The counterfactual runner re-runs the same benchmark with the same seeds and compares pairwise with bootstrap confidence intervals. Each agent additionally gets its own random stream so removing one agent does not perturb the others (experimental control).

**Intelligence vs coordination**: compare strong single agent, strong swarm, weak swarm, weak agents without coordination to separate capability from coordination.

**Efficiency frontier**: expose the success/cost trade-off as a Pareto frontier instead of a composite score; an architecture is interesting when it moves the frontier.

## 7. Reports (`report/`)

Health report with separate dimensions (no universal score), agent table, diagnostics with observation / hypothesis / recommendation kept explicit, and causal tables. HTML output adds the execution graph, a timeline with the critical path highlighted, and frontier plots. Machine-readable: JSON, JSONL events, OpenTelemetry-compatible spans.

## 8. From evaluation to optimization (`optimize/`)

Observe → diagnose → generate candidate architectures → predict → benchmark → compare → validate → deploy → observe again. Candidates are produced from diagnostics with heuristic predictions, labelled hypotheses, then run as counterfactuals and accepted, rejected or marked inconclusive on measured deltas.

## 9. Evaluation validity (`validity.py`, `stats.py`)

Repeated trials and distributions rather than single runs; Wilson and bootstrap confidence intervals; evaluator agreement; deterministic seeds derived from (seed, task, trial); experimental controls; benchmark leakage detection (answer fragments in prompts or tool arguments before any tool result supplied them).

## 10. Benchmark design (`schema.Task`, `schema.Benchmark`)

Task = input, expected behaviour, success criteria, constraints, evaluator spec, optional reference, difficulty, category. Benchmarks are plain JSON/JSONL so different architectures are evaluated under identical conditions.

## 11. Phases

| Phase | Deliverable | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Observability & evaluation | reproducible trace + evaluation report | **done** (`schema`, `recorder`, `runner`, `evaluators`, `metrics/performance`, `metrics/efficiency`, `report/text`, `export/jsonl`, `integrations/anthropic`, CLI) |
| 2 Coordination analysis | explain where the swarm is inefficient and why | planned (`graph/`, `metrics/coordination`, `diagnostics/`) |
| 3 Causal & research features | estimate which components actually matter | planned (`causal/`, confidence intervals in `stats`, `validity`) |
| 4 Optimization | experimentally validated architecture improvements | planned (`optimize/`) |

Phase 1 records everything later phases need (messages with kinds, artifact provenance via `input_artifacts` and `consume`, span nesting, timestamps) so trajectories captured now remain analysable when those layers land.

## 12. Central research question

> When does adding more agents actually make an AI system better?

SwarmEval investigates capability + coordination + parallelism + specialization − communication − redundancy − cost − latency, and the deeper questions of agent value, coordination value, scaling, specialization, redundancy, robustness, architecture generalisation and economics.

## 13. Principles

1. Observe before optimizing.
2. Activity is not contribution.
3. Correlation is not causation.
4. Recommendations are hypotheses.
5. Preserve underlying measurements.
6. Compare against strong baselines.
7. Measure the trade-offs.
8. Reproduce experiments.

## 14. Thesis

Trajectory observability provides the evidence. Causal ablation provides the experimental mechanism. Coordination analysis provides the explanation. Diagnostics provide the hypotheses. Benchmarking provides the validation. Optimization provides the improvement.

Multi-agent engineering moves from *build → run → look at success rate → guess* to *observe → measure → understand → hypothesise → intervene → measure causal effect → validate → optimize → repeat*.
